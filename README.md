# Data Science, Machine Learning, and Artificial Intelligence Resources

Welcome! 

Here is a non-exaustive, work in progress list of resources for data science, machine learning, artificial intelligence, data and text analytics, and data visualization.

I've also included links for web and API development, programming languages, DevOps tools, cloud computing, and more.

Note that resources are listed in no particular order of preference or relevance. Well... maybe except for my blog :)
